# Markdown

## Supported (MVP)

- Headings (`#` .. `######`)
- Lists (ordered/unordered)
- Code fences (```), with language class
- Blockquotes
- Tables (basic)
- Links and images (URLs sanitized)

## Tips

- Use `title:` frontmatter to control sidebar labels.
- Prefer relative links for internal navigation.
