# Performance

Dock5 is designed to feel like a fast SPA while still being static-host-friendly.

## Current baseline

- Pre-rendered HTML (no Markdown parsing at runtime)
- Hash routing by default
- Minimal dependencies for the MVP compiler

## Next ideas

- Optional search index generation at build-time
- Lazy-load heavier features (e.g. code highlighting)
