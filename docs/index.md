Dock5 is a modern, static Markdown documentation engine:

- No backend required (static-host friendly).
- Build-time generation: Markdown -> safe HTML -> a JSON manifest.
- Fast SPA navigation with theming.

This `docs/` folder is the canonical documentation for the dock5 project, and it’s also the default docs input for `pnpm dev` in this repo.
